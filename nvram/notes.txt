programming:
# minipro -p "DS1225 (RW)" -w <filename.bin>

this will probably give a warning "Overcurrent protection! Erase failed!"
but the erase is probably fine so try again but without erasing
# minipro -p "DS1225 (RW)" -w <filename.bin> -e

then readback what was programmed and make sure it matches
probably unnecessary (there's a verification step after programming) but makes 
me feel better
# minipro -p "DS1225 (RW)" -r <filename_readback.bin>
